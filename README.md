# Like You Mean It Records Website

I run a small record label with my friends. This is going to be it's website.

## A hub for fans to keep track of their favorite Like You Mean It Bands

Fans will be able to see a calendar of upcoming events, a given band's releases, as well as the most recent releases on the home page.

## A hub for artists to post their releases and upcoming shows in town

Artists will be able to create and edit releases and shows.

## Stretch Goals (in no particular order):

* Add socials icons to each band's profile
* Display the label's 12 or so most recent Instagram posts on the home page
* Implement a detailed release page with track list
* In tandem with that, within the Add Release component for an artist, provide the ability to add songs (title and track number for now)

That's all for the moment. I will continue to keep this README updated as I move forward with the project.
